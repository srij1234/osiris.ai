 Your foster parents told us you've been in contact with your mother. Can we talk about that? I want to talk about my money. Mercedes. $50,000. My father left that money to me. That money is gone. And that's not why we're here. Mercedes, we were under the impression that you had no interest in relationship with your mother. And to be honest, we're not sure it's a good idea. But we're willing to talk about it if you are. Mercedes. Mercedes. At 18 years old, you could split my life directly in half, right down the middle. Nine years before Mercedes moved to Needles, California, and then nine years since. She was troubled in the right way. I wanted everything to do with her, and she wanted the opposite. So when people ask how I could do it I did. How I could even think about it. I tell them the gods are on a truth. I've been in love with Mercedes Harper for as long as I could remember. Hey. Hi. Hey. Hi. Hey. You said that already. Can I help you with something? I'm going to rob a bank. You want it? What? A bank. It's where they keep money, vault, tellers, etc. Yeah, I'm familiar with the concept of banks. I'm just curious if I were telling you this. I read your story about the bank robbery. I found it inspiring. So I'm going to rob a bank and wonder if you're interested. You are. You're insane. I've seen you watch me. What? Middle school. High school. Just now when I was boring poppy, when you think I'm not looking you watch me. Do you deny this? I know. I mean, yes. Did someone put you up to this? Yeah, I just forget it. Don't call the cops, okay? Wait. I don't know. I said that. It was fine. See you at seven. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're calling at the morning. Finally, we're coming to the store. We're coming to the store. We're coming to the store. We're coming to the store. We're coming to the store. We're coming to the store. Hi. It's Mercedes. Your daughter. I talked to my caseworker and foster parents and they said that the money was going to be transferred on my 18th birthday. So I guess I'll be seeing you not too long after that. Okay. Bye. Come on, you idiot. So where do we start? Do you live out here now? Yeah, I'm a box-car child. Oh. I live in a house like a normal person. This is just a place. So where do we start? So I've thought about it and I'm prepared to give you some hypothetical advice on how to rob a hypothetical bank. Hypothetically. Can you tell me why you think you need to do that? I'm in trouble. Get out of needles. You want to get out of needles? Yeah, for sure. That's why I'm going to college. So weren't you at UNLV with your two little friends? Oh, I'm actually sitting up for Stanford. It's like this dream I've had since I was really old. Okay, great. So we're going to split the money 50-50. You go to college. And lose because college is for losers. So where do we start? Well, if we're really going to rob a bank, we turn on it. Then we'd start by finding the right bank. So I guess you couldn't find a bigger bank. Well, so this is the furthest bank in the county from the Sheriff's office. Meaning you'll have like four minutes before any cops show up, even after the silent alarms. Four minutes. Four minutes. Not bad, Mr. Denver. Not bad. Look, even if you got the money out of the bank, you'd still have explosive dipax and GPS tracking devices that the tailor can slip in with the money. So I don't really see a way that you can... But that doesn't always happen. True, but it's a huge risk. And while we're on the subject of bad news, you wouldn't be able to change your routine for like three months after. It'd be too suspicious. Somehow you're managing to look all the excitement out of bank robbery. The tailor is a friend of my foster parents. I completely forgot he worked at a bank under the... Are you sure you'd recognize him? Yeah. Oh, I guess that's it then. You give a shot. No, it just means that I'd be the getaway driver and my partner would go in. Well, you'd have to find somebody willing to do that. Not me. I thought you said no guns means less money. The average is like ten thousand. I said fifty. Look, you have to use a threatening note. It's less dangerous, less prison time. Less money. But... Do you have an idea for that? But you're not going to like it. You're trying to kill me right now. All right, if we were to rob a bank after a cash delivery, I think we could raise the average. We just got to figure out the armored truck schedule. So how many days are we going to have to sit here? It's one of the tanks. Do you have a tire being sold in, boy? Do you ever get tired of being sold in means? So the dog facts and tracking device are programmed to be sold in means. So the dog facts and tracking device are programmed to detonate 30 feet from the transmitter thingy inside the bank. Which is a huge problem. I'm left. You have one of these. Fish deck. It'd be full of water and water is really bad for electronic stuff. So it would like, short out or something. Not bad, Miss Mercedes. Ah. Welcome to adulthood. How do you know it was my birthday? Facebook. Right. She's gonna open it. Sorry, if you want you can get it back. No, no, it's... Thanks. So on Tuesday, the armored car showed up at... 848 am. On the security guys? 736 and 31 seconds. What? Are you actually considering this? Like as a genuine life pet? Oh, I shouldn't I? I don't know. You mean besides prison and health? What about your family? You don't miss them? I don't know, like annoying. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't. Sorry. We just stop saying sorry. Sorry. If you want to say something, say it. If you want to do something, do it. Stop apologizing for resisting. I'm sorry. If you say sorry, I'm gonna punch you in the face. Alright. I'm not sorry. So what about fake license plates? I think that we could print them ourselves. Yeah, yeah, we could do that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you serious? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't believe you didn't forgive us out. Bandages, they cover the face without you know. Okay, what's your deal? Are we doing this? I feel like we've been over this. Oh, and another real reason. Why are we planning a bank robbery? I'm gonna make something clear for you, Denver. I'm not your little girlfriend. I'm not your buddy. Anything you think you know about me, you don't. So if you're not here to help, I don't know why you are. I'm gonna... And then... What? You want to rob the bank? Just rob the bank. All right, get a go. Alright. Here we go. Hey. I don't know anything stupid, okay? Hey. Do you know anything stupid, okay? Hi. Sorry about that. My car just died. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. My car just died. I could really use a jump. Oh no, no, no, thank you. It'll only take a minute. And you put on me a huge jump. Would you, oh, would you mind just losing? Please. Please. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. What happened, are you okay? What happened? What happened? Hold on. All right love. Get underneath. Good afternoon side, your Mar 여기서. What? What the hell are you talking about? How much did you get? 11,000? There's a best I could do that's only a gift. No, it's not good enough. For who for your mom would ever? What did you say? Get out. What? Get out of the car! You know what? What? You know what? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Hi. I hope it's okay that I came now. I don't want it to be a hassle. No! No! I'm sorry. They're in out of color. Oh no, this is great. Thank you. You're so beautiful. Thank you. So... Did you bring it? It was the money. Yeah. It... It got rained on. Oh my God, that's so child. It's only 14,000. Oh, hopefully that's enough for now. But I told you the treatments were 50. I'm so sorry. I understand. Why would you tell me you had the money if you didn't have the money? No. No. Do you really have cancer? No. No. What's this all about? I don't know. I don't know. Two days ago, I robbed the Bank of Easter California on Valley View. Give me a second. Okay. Is your friend? Denver Thomas from Needles. You don't know. Well, it seems this kid comes into the bank, makes a 911 phone call, and anonymously reports a bank robbery in progress at that location. He then withdraws $14,435 from his own college savings account. Then, as he's exiting the premises, he pulls the fire alarm and runs off. Do me a favor and tell your little boyfriend that if you do something like this again, there's going to be hell to me. Do you understand? So, when people ask how I could do what I did, how I could even think about it. I tell them the gods on a strewd. I had been in love with Mercedes-Hopper for as long as I can remember. Hey. Hi. Hey. I said that already. Hey. Hey. Hey. Come up in the rain. Come up in the rain. Crickety eyes are singing. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
