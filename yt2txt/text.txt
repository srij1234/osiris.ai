 Welcome to English in a minute. If you've ever gardened, you know weeds grow super fast. They can take over a garden overnight. But what does grow like a weed mean in other situations? Hey, Dan, do you want to see pictures from my trip home? Oh, geez, I would love to. But... Great. This is me with my little cousin Arlo. Little? He's taller than you. I know. He is growing like a weed. He's only 10. Does he have a beard? To grow like a weed just means to grow very quickly. We mostly use this expression when talking about how fast children grow. And that's English in a minute.
